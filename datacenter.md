## E.Datacenter.2: Carbon footprint of data centers

### E.Datacenter.2.a:

The yearly cost and CO2 footprint of Google's data center at Singapore have been
added to the [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gh869zfjA4sVxL8-ga0af2_HLTTuOoD1IReuRSrbq4I/edit#gid=0).

### E.Datacenter.2.b:

The 230,455 sq. ft. [1] Google data center at Singapore is the first Google
data center in South East Asia [2]. It came online in December 2013. Google is
developing two more data centers at the same location.

This data center uses an estimated 25 MW of power with a PUE of 1.15 [3].

Then the IT Load of the center can be calculated as 

PUE = Total Load / IT Load [4]

IT Load = Total Load / PUE

IT Load = 25 * 1000/1.15 =  21740 kW

On putting these values in the [Schneider Electric Data Center Carbon
Footprint Calculator](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/work/solutions/system/s1/data-center-and-network-systems/trade-off-tools/data-center-carbon-footprint-comparison-calculator/),
the yearly cost and carbon footprint of the data center were calculated as follows:


| Data center |	Electricity Cost ($/kW) |	IT Load (kW) |	Yearly Cost ($) | Yearly CO2 Footprint (tons) |	CO2 equivalent in cars |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Singapore Jurong West | 0.13 |	21,740 |	29.6M |	160,089 |	35,293 |

## E.Datacenter.4: Hydro Power

Hydro power is energy in moving water[5]. It is one of the oldest sources for
producing electricity. It is generated by rotating big turbines in heavy flowing
streams or rivers or using a dam that releases water when necessary. The
turbines then spin a generator that produces electricity.

Hydro electricity accounts for nearly 7% of total electricity produced and 23%
of the electricity produced using renewable resources in the US.

### Data centers that run on hydro power

* Near the Linth river in Switzerland, Data Center Light has established one of
a kind of data center that boasts of an in-house hydro-power plant. It uses
electricity generated by 100% renewable resources. It generates over 8000 MW/h
of energy per year[6].
* Facebook opened a data center in Lulea, Sweden that is mostly powered by 
locally generated hydroelectric power. The center has a great PUE rating due to 
factors such as using natural air to cool the systems and using efficient 
hardware[7].
* Hydro66, a British corporation, has opened a 1000 sq. m. data center in North
Sweden close to the Facebook's data center. This facility also uses the hydro 
electric power generated by the local plant.

## E.Datacenter.5: California

* In September 2018, California passed a bill to move the entire power grid to
renewable energy [11]. 
* California also has an issued order to remove as much carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere as it emits [12].
* The California Energy Commission estimates that 32 percent of retail energy
sales were powered by renewable sources last year [12]. 
* California has large energy resources, being among the top producers of oil,
hydroelectricity, solar, biomass, and geothermal energy in the United States
[13].
* Due to strict emission laws no coal-fired power plants operate in California. 
* California leads the nation in electricity generation from non-hydroelectric
renewable energy sources, including geothermal power, wind power, and solar
power.
* The site <https://www.dsireusa.org/> has several state incentives for 
residential to big corporations to promote the use of renewable energy.

## E.Datacenter.8:

In August 2019, a power outage at Nissan data center in Denver, Colorado led
to four days of shut down of most of the Nissan and Infiniti dealerships
across North America, Canada and Mexico [10].

**Reason for data center outage** 

Extreme heat in Colorado led to multiple
power outages in the Denver area. The Nissan data center was also affected
by this power outage. The power outage disabled the backup systems and made
the recovery even more difficult [8].
  
**Effects of data center outage**

* The power breakdown resulted in their communication system called NNANet to
shut down. This resulted in the dealers not being able to order new cars
, parts, file warranty claims, check the inventory of other dealers or customer
payoff information [9].
* The dealers couldn't make any sales [9].
* The data crash also brought down production at Nissan's factories in
Tennessee and Mississippi [10].

**How it could have been avoided**

It took four days for the data center to recover from this outage. This was
because the backup systems were co-located and were affected by the same power
outage. If there are multiple data centers for a big corporation, a backup of
data, applications, and systems should be kept in a different region because
it is has a very less chance of affecting different locations [8].
