## E.Datacenter.2: Carbon footprint of data centers

### E.Datacenter.2.a:

The yearly cost and CO2 footprint of Google's data center at Singapore has been
added to the [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gh869zfjA4sVxL8-ga0af2_HLTTuOoD1IReuRSrbq4I/edit#gid=0).

### E.Datacenter.2.b:

The 230,455 sq. ft. [@ref-1] Google data center at Singapore is the first
 Google data
center in South East Asia [2]. It came online in December 2013. Google is
developing two more data centers at the same location. 

This data center uses an estimated 25 MW of power with a PUE of 1.15 [3].

Then the IT Load of the center can be calculated as 

PUE = Total Load / IT Load [4]

IT Load = Total Load / PUE

IT Load = 25 * 1000/1.15 =  21740 kW

On putting these values in the [Schneider Electric Data Center Carbon
Footprint Calculator](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/work/solutions/system/s1/data-center-and-network-systems/trade-off-tools/data-center-carbon-footprint-comparison-calculator/), the yearly cost and carbon footprint of
 the data center can be calculated.
 
 Following is the cost of the Google data center in Singapore.

| Data center |	Electricity Cost ($/kW) |	IT Load (kW) |	Yearly Cost ($) | Yearly CO2 Footprint (tons) |	CO2 equivalent in cars |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Singapore Jurong West | 0.13 |	21,740 |	29.6M |	160,089 |	35,293 |
